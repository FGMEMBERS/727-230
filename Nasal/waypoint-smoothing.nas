#
# Usage:
#
# Add this script to the aircraft-set.xml file, in the Nasal section.
#
# <nasal>
#     <MyAircraft>
#         <file>Nasal/waypoint-smoothing.nas</file>
#     </MyAircraft>
# </nasal>
#
# No other configuration is required. Smoothing is activated with the route
# manager and deactivated when the route is deactivated after landing. This
# assumes the autopilot uses (controls/autoflight/bank-angle-select) for its
# bank angle limits.
#
# Configuration:
#
# The following can be added to the aircraft-set.xml to customize defaults,
# but it is not necessary to do so.
#
# <autopilot>
#     <route-manager>
#         <smoothing>
#             <sharp-turn-threshold type="int">120</sharp-turn-threshold>
#             <sharp-turn-lead-time type="double">5.0</sharp-turn-lead-time>
#             <smooth-turn-lead-time type="double">5.0</smooth-turn-lead-time>
#         </smoothing>
#     </route-manager>
# </autopilot>
#
# A waypoint transition will not be smoothed if the difference between the
# bearing inbound (not necessarily the leg bearing) and the bearing outbound
# is greater than (sharp-turn-threshold). The idea is to allow fly-through
# waypoints as encountered in some STAR routes.

# In the case of sharp turns, the transition is led by a small number of
# seconds (sharp-turn-lead-time) to avoid S-turns at the waypoint.
#
# For smooth turns, a lead time is configurable as (smooth-turn-lead-time) to
# account for the delay in getting in and out of the turn. The early
# transition of a waypoint is calculated with a theoretical turn radius and
# failing to account for a lead-in and lead-out causes the turn to be made
# slightly late. If your aircraft is consistently turning late, increase
# (smooth-turn-lead-time).
#
# Note that turn radius is calculated on the property
# (controls/autoflight/bank-angle-select). It is assumed that this property
# is configured (default is 30) and used to set the bank angle on the
# autopilot. If not, just set it to whatever fixed bank your autopilot uses.
#
# Smoothing can be turned on and off during a route manager flight by setting
# the (autopilot/route-manager/smoothing/enabled) property to 1 and 0
# respectively.
#
# NOTE THAT USING NASAL IN THE ROUTE MANAGER IS NOT THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE
# WAYPOINT SMOOTHING PROBLEM BECAUSE OF NASAL GARBAGE COLLECTION DELAYS. THIS
# SCRIPT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A TEMPORARY SOLUTION UNTIL WAYPOINT SMOOTHING IS
# BUILT INTO THE AUTOPILOT USING PROPERTY RULES.
